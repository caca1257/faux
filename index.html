            <h2>Opportunity</h2>
            <p>Homeowners in many Northeastern cities deal with the hassle of clearing their driveways of snow on many occasions each year. This task is stressful, time-consuming, and hard on the body and mind. These customers would benefit greatly from the option of a less expensive one-time shovel or plow from another member of the neighborhood looking to make some extra money. Snuber will effectively connect these two parties to satisfy the needs of both.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Snuber Concept</h2>
            <p>The Snuber application and website will connect homeowners to shovelers or plow drivers. The customer will request a driveway clearing through the application or website, inputting their home address, driveway size, and urgency of request. Our technology will then connect whichever of our many shovelers and plow drivers is closest to that GPS location, and that snow-clearer will be on their way shortly.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Marketing Strategy</h2>
            <p>Snuber wants customers to view the company as a convenient, stress-relieving service that is a less expensive option than its competitors. Potential customers will need to be tech-savvy, in order to place an order through the application or website. To reach this audience, Snuberâ€™s marketing campaign will focus heavily on online advertisements in social media applications and search engine banner ads.</p>
